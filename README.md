# jPathfinder

<img src="jPathfinder.png" />

A quick app that visualises Dijkstra and A* pathfinding algorithms. Written in Java using JavaFX and my own [SquareGrid](https://github.com/SpinningVinyl/SquareGrid) class.

## Usage

The user interface is pretty self-explanatory.

The load and save functionality is a bit sketchy at the moment but it works most of the time.

## Legend

Pink squares represent settled nodes, pale blue squares represent unsettled nodes, red squares represent the path (if it exists) and the fuchsia square is the current node.
