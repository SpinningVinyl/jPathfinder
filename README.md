# jPathfinder

<img src="jPathfinder.png" />

A quick app that visualises Dijkstra and A* pathfinding algorithms. Written in Java using JavaFX and my own [SquareGrid](https://github.com/SpinningVinyl/SquareGrid) class.

The load and save functionality is a bit sketchy at the moment but it works most of the time.
